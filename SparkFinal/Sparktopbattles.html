                <li><h3>Ichigo vs. Ulquiorra</h3><iframe width="400" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BD-VH29sVgc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </li>
                This is one of today's longest and most dramatic battles, where Ichigo and Ulquiorra attack not just each other's bodies, but their very ideologies. Action-packed, riddled with classic Bleach tunes, and containing more than a few twists, Ichigo's bout with the emerald Espada will long be remembered.
                <li><h3>Saitama vs. Genos</h3><iframe width="400" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlqnyMzuU30" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                Brief, but showcasing incredible animation, the battle does justice to Saitama's near-invincible strength while also highlighting Genos's own talents. More modern than today's other entries, these dazzling visuals were truly a wonder to behold.

                <li><h3>Goku vs Frieza</h3><iframe width="400" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8nGStHaz2RQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                One of the longest matches ever witnessed in anime—the original fight spans over 15 episodes—Goku took on his Saiyan race's destroyer, Frieza, in a terrific fight. Goku's various tactics initially prove futile, but he eventually gains the long-foreshadowed Super Saiyan transformation, precipitating a battle with the fate of the universe at stake.

                <li><h3>Madara vs Shinobi Alliance</h3><iframe width="400" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83VEnra5Vw0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                To prove the prowess of the main antagonist, anime often present battles where the villain dominates several opponents at once. Madara here is no exception, and I appreciate several aspects of this particular example. Battling hundreds of united ninja—including prominent characters such as Naruto and Gaara—Madara certainly demonstrates his power, but the Alliance proves their mettle at points, too. They successfully repel Madara's fire justu with a united water blast, and work together well to counter Madara's giant meteor, showing they're more than worthless grunts for Madara to ragdoll around.
                </li>
                <li><h3>Naruto Uzumaki Vs. Sasuke Uchiha - 'Naruto'</h3><iframe width="400" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G80i5wmF6hw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha sported a rivalry since the very beginning, a rivalry that suggested to viewers the series wouldn't end without a serious showdown between the two powerhouse ninjas.

                The animation and choreography combine to form fight-scene magic. In long-running anime like Naruto, this can feel hit-or-miss, yet Sudio Pierrot put forth some of their finest efforts here. Viewers watch Sasuke and Naruto defend their differing worldviews while still showing a level of respect. The battle continues even after their incredible powers burn out, devolving into an exhausted fist fight atypical of Naurto's usual flashy choreography. In short, it gives the fans what they waited for as well as some surprises they never expected either.
